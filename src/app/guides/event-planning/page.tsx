        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. Pre-Planning Phase</h3>
        <p>
          Begin by establishing your event&apos;s core objectives, target audience, and desired outcomes. Create a detailed budget that accounts for all potential expenses, including venue rental, catering, entertainment, and contingency funds. Develop a realistic timeline with key milestones and deadlines.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. Venue Selection</h3>
        <p>
          Choose a venue that aligns with your event&apos;s size, style, and budget. Consider factors such as location accessibility, parking availability, and technical capabilities. Always have a backup plan for outdoor events.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. Vendor Management</h3>
        <p>
          Carefully select and coordinate with vendors, including caterers, decorators, and technical support. Maintain clear communication channels and ensure all contracts clearly outline services, deliverables, and contingency plans.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Day-of Execution</h2>
        <p>
          Create a detailed schedule for the event day, including setup times, staff briefings, and key event moments. Assign clear roles and responsibilities to team members and maintain open communication channels. Have contingency plans ready for common issues like technical difficulties or weather changes.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Post-Event Activities</h2>
        <p>
          Conduct a thorough evaluation of the event&apos;s success against initial objectives. Gather feedback from attendees, vendors, and team members. Document lessons learned and areas for improvement for future events.
